## Roadmap for System designing

As a fresher in an IT product-based company aiming to master software design, including both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**, you need a structured roadmap to build a strong foundation and progressively develop expertise. Below is a comprehensive roadmap tailored for you to learn software designing and enable you to contribute to building robust software products.

---

### Roadmap to Learn Software Designing (HLD and LLD)

#### Phase 1: Build a Strong Foundation (1-2 Months)
Understand the basics of programming, computer science concepts, and software development principles to prepare for software design.

1. **Master a Programming Language**
   - Choose one language to start (e.g., **Python**, **Java**, or **C++**) based on your company’s tech stack or project requirements.
   - Learn syntax, data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs), and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion).
   - Resources:
     - Books: “Clean Code” by Robert C. Martin (for coding best practices).
     - Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codecademy.
   - Practice: Solve 50-100 basic coding problems to gain confidence.

2. **Understand Core Computer Science Concepts**
   - **Operating Systems**: Processes, threads, memory management, file systems.
   - **Networking**: HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, REST APIs.
   - **Databases**: Relational (SQL) vs. NoSQL, basic queries, indexing.
   - Resources:
     - FreeCodeCamp (YouTube tutorials).
     - Coursera: “Introduction to Computer Science” courses.
   - Practice: Set up a simple database (e.g., MySQL) and write basic queries.

3. **Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Master OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
   - Understand SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
   - Resources:
     - Book: “Head First Design Patterns” by Eric Freeman.
     - YouTube: Traversy Media or Tech With Tim.
   - Practice: Build small projects (e.g., a library management system) using OOP.

4. **Version Control and Collaboration**
   - Learn **Git** and platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
   - Understand branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews.
   - Resources: GitHub’s official Git guide, Atlassian Git tutorials.
   - Practice: Contribute to an open-source project or create a personal repository.

#### Phase 2: Introduction to Software Design (2-3 Months)
Focus on understanding software design principles, patterns, and the difference between HLD and LLD.

1. **Learn Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
   - Study SDLC phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
   - Understand Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies.
   - Resources: Coursera’s “Software Engineering” courses, Atlassian Agile tutorials.

2. **Understand High-Level Design (HLD)**
   - **What is HLD?**: HLD focuses on system architecture, components, and their interactions at a high level.
   - Key concepts:
     - System architecture (monolithic, microservices, serverless).
     - Scalability, availability, fault tolerance.
     - Load balancers, caching, database sharding.
   - Tools: Learn to create architecture diagrams (e.g., using Lucidchart, Draw.io).
   - Resources:
     - Book: “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann.
     - YouTube: Gaurav Sen’s system design playlist.
   - Practice: Design HLD for simple systems (e.g., a URL shortener, chat application).

3. **Understand Low-Level Design (LLD)**
   - **What is LLD?**: LLD focuses on detailed design of individual components, classes, and methods.
   - Key concepts:
     - Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, UML (Unified Modeling Language).
     - Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.).
     - Code modularity and reusability.
   - Resources:
     - Book: “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” by Gang of Four.
     - YouTube: Tech Dummies (Narendra L) for LLD patterns.
   - Practice: Write code for design patterns (e.g., implement a Singleton class).

4. **Learn Design Patterns**
   - Study creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
   - Examples: Factory, Adapter, Decorator, Command.
   - Resources: Refactoring Guru (website), “Head First Design Patterns.”
   - Practice: Implement 5-10 design patterns in your chosen programming language.

#### Phase 3: Deep Dive into System Design (3-4 Months)
Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios and learn advanced concepts for designing scalable systems.

1. **Advanced High-Level Design**
   - Study distributed systems concepts:
     - CAP theorem, eventual consistency.
     - Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
     - API design (REST, GraphQL).
   - Learn to estimate system requirements (e.g., throughput, latency, storage).
   - Resources:
     - Book: “System Design Interview” by Alex Xu.
     - YouTube: TechWithMaddy, System Design Interview channel.
   - Practice: Design systems like:
     - E-commerce platform.
     - Social media feed.
     - Ride-sharing app.

2. **Advanced Low-Level Design**
   - Focus on writing modular, testable, and maintainable code.
   - Learn to create detailed class and sequence diagrams for complex modules.
   - Study Domain-Driven Design (DDD) basics.
   - Resources:
     - Book: “Domain-Driven Design” by Eric Evans (skim relevant chapters).
     - YouTube: ArjanCodes for advanced Python design.
   - Practice: Design LLD for components like:
     - Payment gateway integration.
